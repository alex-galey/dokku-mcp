# Code Quality and Security Assessment

## üîç Overview

This document outlines the security assessment and code quality analysis performed on the dokku-mcp codebase. The project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for managing Dokku applications via SSH.

## ‚úÖ Security Strengths Found

### 1. Command Injection Protection
- **Comprehensive Input Validation**: The `ValidateCommand` function in `client.go` implements strict validation for dangerous characters including `;`, `&`, `|`, `` ` ``, `$`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `<`, `>`, newline, and carriage return
- **Command Whitelisting**: Only allows alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and colons in command names
- **Runtime Blacklist Configuration**: Supports configurable command blacklists to prevent destructive operations
- **Multi-layered Validation**: Commands are validated at multiple points before execution

### 2. SSH Security Implementation
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Uses `filepath.Clean()` to prevent directory traversal attacks in SSH key paths
- **Key File Validation**: Properly checks file accessibility and permissions before using SSH keys
- **SSH Agent Management**: Secure fallback mechanism with proper SSH_AUTH_SOCK validation
- **Connection Security**: Configures SSH with appropriate security options including timeouts and host key checking

### 3. Configuration Security
- **Input Sanitization**: All configuration inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Secure Defaults**: Uses secure-by-default configuration patterns
- **Environment Variable Handling**: Proper separation of configuration from secrets
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout the configuration system

### 4. Error Handling
- **No Information Leakage**: Error messages are properly sanitized to avoid exposing sensitive system information
- **Secure Logging**: Sensitive data is not logged in debug or error messages
- **Graceful Degradation**: Proper fallback mechanisms for authentication and configuration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Security Concerns Identified

### 1. SSH Host Key Checking (Low Risk)
**Location**: `internal/dokku-api/ssh_config.go`
- **Issue**: `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` is set by default
- **Risk**: Makes connections vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Recommendation**: Consider making this configurable or implementing proper host key verification for production environments

### 2. Default SSH Configuration (Low Risk)
**Location**: `pkg/config/config.go`
- **Issue**: Default SSH key path uses a test value (`"dokku_mcp_test"`)
- **Risk**: May cause confusion in production deployments
- **Recommendation**: Use empty string as default to rely on SSH agent or user's default key

### 3. Timeout Configuration (Low Risk)
**Location**: `internal/dokku-api/ssh_config.go`
- **Issue**: Maximum timeout is set to 10 minutes
- **Risk**: Could potentially allow long-running connections in attack scenarios
- **Current Mitigation**: This is reasonable for the intended use case

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Implement Host Key Verification**: Make SSH host key checking configurable with secure defaults
2. **Add Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for command execution to prevent brute force attacks
3. **Audit Logging**: Enhance audit logging for security-relevant operations

### Medium Priority
1. **Configuration Validation**: Add more strict validation for SSH host formats
2. **Secret Management**: Consider integration with external secret management systems
3. **Network Security**: Document network security requirements and recommendations

### Low Priority
1. **Default Configuration**: Review and update default configuration values for production use
2. **Error Messages**: Review error messages for any potential information leakage
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Implement regular dependency vulnerability scanning

## ‚úÖ Code Quality Strengths

### 1. Architecture
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-structured with clear separation of concerns
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper use of dependency injection with Uber FX
- **Interface-based Design**: Good use of interfaces for testability and modularity
- **Plugin System**: Extensible plugin architecture for server functionality

### 2. Testing
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Good unit test coverage with Ginkgo/Gomega
- **Integration Testing**: Includes integration tests for SSH functionality
- **Security Testing**: Specific tests for command validation and blacklist functionality
- **Test Organization**: Well-organized test suites with proper setup/teardown

### 3. Code Organization
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear domain models and value objects
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a well-defined single responsibility
- **Consistent Patterns**: Consistent coding patterns and conventions throughout
- **Documentation**: Good inline documentation and examples

### 4. Go Best Practices
- **Strong Typing**: Proper use of Go's type system
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns
- **Concurrency**: Proper use of goroutines and channels
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and resource management
