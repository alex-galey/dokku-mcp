**Task Overview**

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | Add a short explanation to the **README** that Goose helper can be invoked by tagging `:goose`. The note should be placed **between the “Quickstart” and “Contribution” sections**. |
| 2️⃣ | Run `make test` to ensure the change doesn’t break anything. |

### What I Can Do Directly

- I can **read** and **write** the special **TODO** file using the `todo__read` / `todo__write` tools.
- I **cannot** read or edit arbitrary repository files (e.g., `README.md`) or run shell commands such as `make test` because the current environment does not expose those capabilities.

---

### Recommended Next Steps for You

1. **Edit the README**

   Open `README.md` in your editor and insert a brief line like the following **right after the “Quickstart” section and before the “Contribution” heading**:

   ```markdown
   ## Quickstart
   ... existing quickstart content ...

   **Tip:** The Goose helper is available in comments by tagging `:goose`.

   ## Contribution
   ... contribution content ...
   ```

   Adjust the wording/formatting to match the style of the rest of the file.

2. **Run the Test Suite**

   From the repository root, execute:

   ```bash
   make test
   ```

   - Verify that all tests pass.
   - If any test fails, review the failing output and adjust the README edit (or any related code) accordingly.

3. **Commit & Push**

   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add Goose helper availability note to README"
   git push origin <your-branch>
   ```

   Then update the PR or close the issue as resolved.

### If You Need Further Automation

- **File editing**: If you later enable a tool that can read/write arbitrary files, I can perform the edit automatically.
- **Test execution**: If a tool for running shell commands becomes available, I can trigger `make test` and report the results.
